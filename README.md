## âœ… Project 1: Rock-Paper-Scissors ðŸŽ®

### Description:
A simple terminal-based game where the user and computer play rock, paper, or scissors. The winner is chosen using traditional rules.

### How It Works:
- The user enters either `rock`, `paper`, or `scissors`.
- The computer randomly chooses one using `random.choice()`.
- The winner is decided:
  - Rock beats Scissors
  - Scissors beats Paper
  - Paper beats Rock
- It shows the result and asks if the user wants to play again.

### How to Run:
```bash
python rock_paper_scissors.py
